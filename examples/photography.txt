CAES CASE EXPLANATION

Inappropriate Protography

This example models cases of inappropriate photography. The proposition to prove is wether someone is guilty of 
having broken the law by taking photos when they should not have. If the photos were taken in a private property or 
if there were signs that clearly prohibited taking photos then the photographer might have broken the law, proofs of signs might have 
to be provided. If photos were taken in a public property, it isn't in most cases against the law; exceptions to
that can be taking pictures of people in privacy (or where they can expected to be private) or if it's clearly stated that it isn't allowed
to take pictures.
