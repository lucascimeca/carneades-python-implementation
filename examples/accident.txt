CAES CASE EXPLANATION

Car Accident

This example models cases of car accidents. The proposition to prove is wether an accident was someone's fault.
An accident is someone's fault if they caused the accident or if the violated traffic laws at the time of the accident.
Even in the two cases above mentioned, if one of the two drivers was at the rear of the other it is he/she that most likely (not always) 
will have the fault, given they have failed to stop the car in time.
